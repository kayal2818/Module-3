# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```
a=eval(input())
print("n" not in a)
print("8" in a)
```

## Output
<img width="688" height="173" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba576424-2dbd-48eb-a37e-b99a652d9601" />

## Result
 Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple is written successfully
